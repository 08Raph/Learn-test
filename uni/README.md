# 🎓 Software Engineering University: maintainer's guide

The University is an extra section of Learn. It is plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with no framework and no
build step. It is loaded only when someone opens `#/uni`, so the rest of the site is not slowed down.

> The University is **not an accredited institution** and does not award degrees. It offers a structured
> learning pathway and its own completion certificates, and every page says so.

## What is in the folder

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `university.js` | Core: state, routing, the content parser, home, dashboard, catalogue, course and lesson pages, video centre |
| `uni-assess.js` | Loaded on demand: labs and the grader, examinations, stage finals, projects, portfolio, transcript, certificates |
| `uni-professor.js` | Loaded on demand: the AI Professor (built-in tutor, plus the optional server endpoint) |
| `university.css` | All University styles. Uses the site's existing colour variables, so every theme works |
| `config.js` | The only settings file. Holds the optional AI endpoint URL. **Never put a key here** |
| `data/catalog.js` | The 6 stages and 52 courses: titles, objectives, prerequisites, references |
| `data/stage1a.txt` … `stage6b.txt` | The course content: lessons, knowledge checks, labs, exams, projects |
| `data/videos.js` | The video library |
| `data/tutor-kb.js` | Glossary, error explanations and practice material for the built-in tutor |
| `ai-endpoint-example/` | Server-side examples for connecting a real AI model |

`index.html` contains only small hooks: the `#/uni` route, the home-page button and banner, and a loader.

## Routes (all under the existing hash router)

`#/uni` home · `#/uni/dashboard` · `#/uni/courses` · `#/uni/stage/3` · `#/uni/course/c301` ·
`#/uni/course/c301/lesson/0` · `…/lab` · `…/exam` · `…/project` · `#/uni/final/3` · `#/uni/labs` ·
`#/uni/exams` · `#/uni/projects` · `#/uni/videos` · `#/uni/transcript` · `#/uni/professor`

All file paths are relative, so the site works at `/Learn/` on GitHub Pages and at the root on Netlify.

## How progress works

- A lesson is complete when every knowledge check is answered correctly (and its exercise passes, where the
  language runs in the browser).
- A course is complete when all lessons are done, the programming assignment passes its tests, the examination
  is passed at **70%**, and the project is submitted.
- A stage unlocks when the previous stage's **final examination** is passed at **75%**.
- Retakes are unlimited and every attempt is recorded.
- Written answers and projects are **self-assessed against a published rubric**. This is stated to the
  student. It is not equivalent to marking by a human examiner.
- Progress is stored in the browser (`localStorage`, inside the existing save data) and is included in the
  backup code. Because it is stored on the student's device, it can be edited by the student. **Do not treat
  these grades or certificates as proof for any official purpose.** That would need a server.

## Adding or editing course content

Content lives in the `.txt` files so that it can be edited without touching code.

```
#COURSE c101
#LESSON Title of the lesson | 12            (12 = minutes)
Markdown text: ### headings, lists, tables, **bold**, `code`, fenced code blocks,
```diagram blocks for ASCII diagrams, and callouts starting "> Key idea:", "> In industry:", "> Warning:".
#Q A knowledge-check question?
- a wrong option
* the right option            (exactly one line starts with *)
! Why it is right.
#TRY py | Prompt for an in-lesson exercise   (then @starter, @solution and @tests or @out)
#LAB js | Title of the programming assignment
Brief in markdown.
@starter
…code…
@solution
…code…
@tests
add(2, 3) => 5
inv.count("pen") => 5 ;; inv = Inventory()\ninv.add("pen", 5)      (optional setup after ;;)
@hints
One hint per line, shown one at a time.
#EXAM 20                                     (minutes)
#Q …                                         (multiple choice, 1 mark)
#C js | A coding question                    (3 marks; needs @starter, @solution, @tests)
#W A written question                        (2 marks, self-assessed)
+ A rubric line
#PROJECT Title
Brief.
@requirements / @deliverables               (one per line)
@rubric
Criterion | 25
```

SQL tasks use `@setup` and `@rows`; HTML tasks use `@checks`; C, TypeScript and the online-only languages use
`@out` (expected output). To add a course: add a `C(...)` entry in `data/catalog.js` and a `#COURSE` block in
a stage file. Then bump `UNI_VER` in `index.html` and the cache name in `sw.js`.

**Rules that keep it honest:** every lab must have a `@solution` that passes its own tests and a `@starter`
that does not. Do not add empty courses or placeholder lessons.

## Adding a video

Edit `data/videos.js`; the rules are at the top of that file. Only add videos you have opened yourself that
are published by their rights holder. Never download or re-host a video, and never guess an ID.

## The AI Professor

No AI model is connected. The professor is a built-in tutor made of rules and the course text; the page says
this clearly. To connect a real model later, read `ai-endpoint-example/README.md`. The key must stay on a
server you control.

## Known limits

- **Code that runs in the browser:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, C# and SQL (plus HTML/CSS checks).
  These work offline and are graded by real tests.
- **Java, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin and Bash** need the site's free online code runner and an
  internet connection. If the service is down, the lab says so and is not marked. For that reason the Rust
  assignment is optional and never blocks progress.
- The Python engine is a teaching interpreter, not full CPython: no third-party packages, and whole numbers
  lose precision above about 9 quadrillion.
- **Videos** need the internet and can be withdrawn by their publishers. Each video page links to the
  written lesson that covers the same material.
- **Offline:** the University's core files are cached with the app. Each course file is cached the first
  time it is opened, so courses you have visited work offline afterwards.
- Certificates are images generated in the browser. They are a personal record, not a qualification.
